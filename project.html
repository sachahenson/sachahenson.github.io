                        Accepted economic theory concludes that positive changes in house prices results in more
                        consumer spending and personal investment. As <a
                            href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/how-does-the-housing-market-affect-the-economy">two
                            thirds of Britain’s households are homeowners</a>,
                        house price inflation increases GDP through the boosted consumption generated from higher levels
                        of confidence. As GDP is a key indicator of the economy’s performance, it is critical to assess
                        what influences house prices.</p>

                    <p>One factor affecting house prices is crime because rates of vandalism and anti-social behaviour can be
                        a signal to prospective buyers of the local community health and crimes such as burglary or
                        property damage pose a risk to the property itself and personal safety. Intuitively, high crime
                        rates make local properties less desirable and cost less.</p>

                    <p>Therefore, this project will investigate:</p>
                    <div class="container">
                        <div class="box2">
                            <p>Is there a relationship between house prices and crime?</p>
                            <p>What is the nature of this relationship?</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>To carry out this investigation, this project focuses on London. Chart 1 supports this as London
                        house prices have a greater increasing trend compared to England’s other most populated cities
                        and Chart 2 demonstrates that there is a huge variation in house prices within London thus it is
                        reasonable to investigate if volatile London house prices are related to local crime rates.</p>

                        Chart 1 was made by feeding the 20 most populous UK cities scraped from <a
                            href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/294645/population-of-selected-cities-in-united-kingdom-uk/">Statista</a>
                        into a loop
                        in Google Colaboratory (GC) to scrape and save the average property prices for each city from
                        the <a
                            href="https://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/ukhpi/browse?from=2000-01-01&location=http%3A%2F%2Flandregistry.data.gov.uk%2Fid%2Fregion%2Funited-kingdom&to=2021-10-01&lang=en">Land
                            Registry</a> URL base into an empty data frame (df). This df was remerged with the Statista
                        population estimates which are revealed in Chart 1 via tooltip. Chart 2 uses data from a <a
                            href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/average-house-prices">Land Registry</a> CSV file
                        and I used GC to convert the appropriate columns into numeric data.

                    </p>

                    <p>Whilst preparing the data for Chart 2, I also logged the median house prices because this would
                        reduce skewness towards large values. To merge house prices with crime data collected from the
                        <a href="https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary">Metropolitan Police
                            (MP)</a>, I converted the crime data from wide to long format and ensured the
                        data types of corresponding columns in the house price data matched. Github hosts all the GCs,
                        original and merged datasets.

                        Charts 4 and 5 update automatically and use the coordinates of Becontree and South Kensington
                        which are underground stations in the lowest and highest average house price boroughs,
                        respectively. These coordinates are used in the URL for the <a
                            href="https://data.police.uk/docs/method/crimes-at-location/">MP API</a> of the latest
                        crimes reported
                        at those locations.

            <h2>Challenges in data cleaning and analysis, and the tools used to overcome them</h2>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="box3">
                    <p>The main challenge of Chart 1 was converting the scraped city names into the correct format for
                        the loop. For example, the cities with more than one word such as Edinburgh had to be
                        decapitalised with hyphens to city-of-edinburgh to be fed into the URL base. Another problem is
                        that my analysis has a limited scope of 2008-2017 due to collection processes
                        of the data. To extend this analysis, more data is necessary.</p>

                    <p>The greatest challenge was handling the MP dataset; the crime data for each borough had a major
                        category (e.g. burglary) with one or more minor categories (e.g. 1. in a dwelling 2. in other
                        buildings) for each month every year, but for my analysis I only needed total major counts of
                        crime per year. I used Pandas in GC to make new dfs for each year to individually sum the crime
                        counts and simultaneously absorb the minor counts of crime into one parent major crime category.
                        Finally, the annual crime counts were copied into a central df and merged many-to-one with the
                        logged house prices to establish an all-encompassing df of annual total crime by crime type per
                        borough with the corresponding year’s median house price.

            <h2>My conclusions: is there a relationship between crime and house prices?</h2>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="box3">

                    <p>Using the merged crime and house price dataset, Matplolib estimated a best fit line and I then
                        translated this into VegaLite. From Chart 3, I can conclude that there is some positive
                        relationship between house prices and crime rates across <i>all</i> London. This implies that
                        higher
                        crime rates are associated with higher house prices. Whilst this doesn’t establish causality,
                        this may be because lower house price areas have violent crime as a higher proportion of total
                        crime, but higher income areas have more incidences of petty crime such as on-the-person theft
                        as indicated by Chart 4 compared to 5.</p>

                                var myChartpr3 = "project/Charts/chart3pr_CrimeHouses.json";

                    </div>
                    <p>However, the R squared value calculated using the lingress function imported from SciPy in GC is
                        very low at 0.05, implying that crime explains very little of median house prices. Secondly, the
                        dropdown menu indicates that despite the existence of a general relationship, it is not borough
                        specific; each borough’s annual crime count moves around a certain value whilst local house
                        prices fluctuate. Both observations suggest that house prices are determined by more than local
                        annual crime. This analysis could be extended by studying how and why some crimes are more
                        influential on house prices than others, as explored by <a
